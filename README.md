## Breakdown of the folders and files:

* data/: This folder contains subfolders for different stages of data processing and storage. For example, raw/ may contain raw data files, processed/ stores cleaned and preprocessed data, models/ saves trained models, logs/ stores logs generated during the process, and so on. You can customize these folders based on your project's requirements.

* tasks/: This folder contains separate Python scripts for different tasks in your MLOps pipeline. For example, data_processing.py handles data cleaning and preprocessing, model_training.py trains your machine learning model, model_evaluation.py evaluates the model's performance, deployment.py deploys the model, and so on. You can add or modify these scripts according to your specific tasks.

* utils/: This folder contains utility scripts or modules that provide reusable functions for your tasks. For example, data_loader.py contains functions to load data from various sources, data_preprocessing.py provides functions for data cleaning and preprocessing, model_architecture.py defines the architecture of your machine learning model, evaluation_metrics.py contains functions to evaluate model performance, and so on. You can organize your utility scripts based on their functionality.

* main.py: This is the entry point of your MLOps project. It can orchestrate the execution of different tasks in the appropriate order, manage the flow of data and models between tasks, and handle any other necessary project-level operations.

* config.py: This file contains configuration variables for your project. You can define constants such as file paths, hyperparameters, API keys, or any other project-specific configurations here.

* requirements.txt: This file lists the required Python packages and their versions for your project. It helps ensure that anyone running your project can install the necessary dependencies easily.


# THESIS STRUCTURE
## Chapter 1: Introduction

Introduce the topic of the thesis and the goal of the MLOps project.

Investigate deep learning models for time series forecasting.

## Chapter 3: Data Collection and Preprocessing

Explain the data collection process, including the sources of your monthly time series data.
Describe the steps taken to preprocess the time series data, such as handling missing values, handling outliers, and scaling the data.

## Chapter 4: FAVAR Model

Present the concept and theory behind the FAVAR model.
Describe the implementation of the FAVAR model on your monthly time series data.
Explain how the model is trained, validated, and evaluated.

## Chapter 5: Deep Learning Model

Discuss the theory and architecture of the deep learning model you chose for time series analysis.
Detail the implementation of the deep learning model on your monthly time series data.
Explain the training process, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics used.
Chapter 6: Model Comparison and Evaluation

Compare the performance of the FAVAR model and the deep learning model.
Evaluate the models based on appropriate metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, MAE, etc.
Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

### Chapter 7: Deployment and MLOps

Discuss the deployment process of the chosen models in a production environment.
Describe the MLOps practices and tools used for model deployment, monitoring, and versioning.
Explain how the models can be retrained and updated over time.
Chapter 8: Conclusion and Future Work

Summarize the findings and conclusions from the project.
Discuss potential areas of improvement or future work for expanding the project or enhancing the models.
Remember that this is a general outline, and you should adapt it based on your specific project requirements and guidelines provided by your academic institution.
