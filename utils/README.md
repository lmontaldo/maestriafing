# Utils

The `utils` directory contains utility files and modules that provide commonly used functions, classes, or helper code that can be utilized across different parts of the project. These utility files aim to simplify and streamline various tasks by providing reusable code.

## Contents

The `utils` directory may include the following types of files:

- **data_loader.py**: This file contains functions to load and preprocess data. It provides functionality for reading data from various sources, performing data cleaning, transformation, or feature engineering operations.

- **data_preprocessing.py**: This file includes functions for data preprocessing tasks. It may contain functions for handling missing data, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, or other common preprocessing operations.

- **model_architecture.py**: This file defines the architecture of the machine learning model(s) used in the project. It may contain functions or classes for creating and configuring the model architecture, including layers, connections, and parameter settings.

- **evaluation_metrics.py**: This file contains functions to compute various evaluation metrics. It provides reusable code to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or any other relevant evaluation measures.

Please note that the contents listed above are just examples, and the specific files present in the `utils` directory may vary depending on the requirements of the project.

## Usage

The utility files in the `utils` directory can be imported and used in other parts of the project as needed. They provide reusable code that simplifies common tasks and promotes modularity. To use a utility function or module, you can import it using the `import` statement in your Python code:

```python
from utils.data_loader import load_data
from utils.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data
from utils.model_architecture import create_model
from utils.evaluation_metrics import calculate_accuracy
