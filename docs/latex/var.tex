\subsection{VAR ESTRUCTURAL}
In this section, we will introduce the concept of mathematical equations and their significance in various fields of study.
\subsection{VAR FORMA COMPACTA (REDUCIDA)}
\section{Equations}
One of the fundamental equations in mathematics is the Pythagorean theorem, given by:
\begin{equation}
    a^2 + b^2 = c^244444444444444444444444444444444444444444444
\end{equation}
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right-angled triangle, and \(c\) is the length of the hypotenuse.

\section{Aplicaciones VAR}
The Pythagorean theorem finds applications in various fields, such as engineering, architecture, and physics. For example, it is essential in calculating distances and areas in surveying and mapping.
